# EarlyPredictor
<h2> Problem Statement </h2>

Many people of India are suffering from various types of diseases and most of the people are unaware of the early diagnosis of that disease.The unawareness of diseases leads to very dangerous diseases like cancer, blood-cancer which needs to be predicted from the very early stage.Data proved that most of the people never go for diagnosis from early level which increases the difficulty in the curing that disease. So it is a necessity to detect the disease at a very early stage and it needs to be available at our homes and the person doesn't need to go to the doctor for his/her check-up every week.

<h2> Solution </h2>

As for my problem statement, I want to make a device which will collect a small sample of blood from the person and will process it and show all the details diagnosed from the blood like sugar level, haemoglobin count and other factors. Every week, the person needs to provide a few drops of blood to the machine.With the help of machine learning and artificial intelligence, it process the blood sample and with the help of data from provided previously by the medical scientists, it will be able to predict the disease (going to affect the body) at a very early stage and will help the sufferer to take actions for that disease and hence will the person will be able to cure that disease before affecting the whole body.So, with the help of artificial intelligence and machine learning, one will able to diagnosis his/her body at home and can predict the type of disease at a very early period.
